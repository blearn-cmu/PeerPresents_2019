## PeerPresents 2016 Design Document ##
A Web-Based System for In-Class Peer Feedback during Student Presentations


### Overview
[Engineering overview. Define components and how they interact. Needs reconstructed from twerp repo information.]

### Context
Peer feedback systems enable students to get feedback without substantially burdening the instructor. However, current systems typically ask students to provide feedback after class; this introduces challenges for ensuring relevant, timely, diverse, and sufficient amounts of feedback, and reduces the time available for student reflection. PeerPresents is a novel system for in-class peer review where students can quickly exchange feedback on projects without being burdened by additional work outside of class. We found students can receive immediate, copious, and diverse peer feedback through a structured in-class activity. Students also described the feedback they received as helpful and reported that they gave more feedback than without using the system. These early results demonstrate the potential
benefits of in-class peer feedback systems.

### Stakeholders
* Students presenting their work
* Students giving feedback to peers
* Course Staff or Instructors
* Researchers using data

### Goals and Non-Goals
[Describe user-driven impact of project. Specify how to measure success using metrics.]
* Students Presenting
  * Share content with entire team
  * Write questions to influence feedback they get
  * Direct crowd to questions (ensure they receive feedback)
  * View all feedback their team received
  * Reflect on feedback individually and/or as a team (organization, sorting, visualizing)
* Students giving feedback
  * Give feedback to multiple teams in one session
    * Switch between presentations
  * Give feedback (answer presentor’s questions)
  * View other students’ feedback
  * Reaction to other students’ feedback (vote/emoji/etc)
  * No threaded discussion
* Course Staff
  * How many students are online
  * How many students are active (watching, commenting, reacting)
  * Quality check on feedback students are giving
  * May want to give feedback themselves
  * Want to know something about the reflection process
  * Want system to handle all the logistics
  * Turn features on/off for presentations
* Researchers
  * Group presentations in a study or in a study condition
  * Easily extract data by study
  * Have system capture all relevant data
  * Turn features on/off for particular groups of students
    * A/B Testing
